# Crime Reporting System
This project is part of Newcastle University coursework.
This program can record and display different incidents in specific districts.It can also give a report about incidents 
and districts, depending on what the user inputs.

## Getting Started

This is a pretty straight forward process. All you have to do is to Fork the project to your space and clone the project
to your IDE. And that is all you need to do in order to start.

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK (15) or later.
* IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred IDE).



### Installing

First you will need the Java JDK to be installed to your system. Secondly, you are going to
need an IDE (Intellij, Eclipse) in order to run the program. However, you can run your program via command prompt if 
u are using Windows or terminal if u are on Unix system. Then you need to Fork the project to your personal space and
clone it to your IDE.


## Running the tests

I have created  3 Districts where each of the Districts has 3 Incidents hardcoded in order to test my program.
These hardcoded sample data that I have provided are trying to test the classes, and the complexity of my methods.

## Built With

* IntelliJ IDEA
* Windows 10
